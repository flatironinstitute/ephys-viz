1. Build the docker image

```
docker build -t ephys_viz_enduser_jupyter .
```

2. Run the container (start JupyterLab inside the container)

```
docker run -p 8899:8888 -v $PWD/../../../notebook_examples:/notebook_examples -it ephys_viz_enduser_jupyter jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser --allow-root
```

or replace 8899 by some available local port

3. Connect to JupyterLab in the browser

Follow the instructions at the bottom of the console output of the container to
connect to the the JupyterLab session in the notebook. You will need to
substitute port 8899 (or whatever you chose) for port 8888

4. Open an example notebook

The /notebook_examples directory inside the container should be mounted to the
notebook_examples directory at the base of the repo. Open one of those
notebooks.

5. To test jupyter notebook, rather than lab, replace the word "lab" by "notebook" in the command above
